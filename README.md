# Makublog
Flask based experimental blog to show the power of Makurust.


Recently, I decided to show up the full power of converting Markdown files into static HTML pages. And after some weeks, the main idea came. What if I will mix-up creating blogs using only Markdown and convert directly to hypertext. So, this is sample blog where you can see result. Will be glad for stars in main repository.
